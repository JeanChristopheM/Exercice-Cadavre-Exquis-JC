# Once upon a time,
There was a princess in a castle, locked away in an extremely tall tower. ![alt text](https://img.icons8.com/ios/50/fa314a/tower.png "Logo Title Text 1")

She was crying and sobbing about her situation when all of a sudden, she saw a dragon rushing straight at her! ![alt text](https://static.fnac-static.com/multimedia/Images/FD/Comete/138637/CCP_IMG_ORIGINAL/1820881.jpg)

She finds full of hope and begins to sing a little song ...

Then it rains...

## Love at a funeral
A girl is at the funeral of her mother. She meets a nice guy that she didn’t know who also was at the funeral and they hit it off. She was busy at the funeral and didn’t have time to ask him for his number before he left. She tried really hard to track him down, but no one knew who he was or how to contact him. A few days later her sister dies and the police suspect it to be a murder. Who killed her sister?


As the rains created a river, the princess could see ,not so far away, a little duck named Donald. Even though he was very small, he was was the bravest duck in the realm.
